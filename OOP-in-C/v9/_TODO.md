## Activities with Version 9

### Run the Unit Tests

As usual.

### Run the Demo Application

As usual.

## Following Plan A â€“ Get active with some hands-on coding

Design *Dynamic Buffer Utility* with C based on `snprintf` (a bit
along the lines of `std::ostringstream`-s , if you have prior
experience with C++) and use it as a kind of a "flexible sink" for
output generated from the *Count-Down Demo Application*.

**Note:** The more general goal here is to provide the basic
utilities to include an application in automated testing even if
in its "real use" console output is created.

## Following Plan B - Understand what should have been done

Do a side-by-side comparison with the next (and final) version.

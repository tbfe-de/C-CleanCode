# Activities with Version 1

## Run the Unit Tests

```sh
make
```

The result should look something like this:

```txt
gcc -std=c99 -o assert_based unit_Test.c ChainCounter.c
** unit tests passed **
```

If you repeat the `make` command

## Run the Demo Application

```sh
make run-demo-app
```

The full result should end with something like this:

```txt
gcc -std=c99 -o app_main ChainCounter.c DDD_HH_MM_SS.c
  4d03h02m01s -- next: 6808 steps of 356521 remaining
  4d01h08m33s -- next: 5250 steps of 349713 remaining
  3d23h41m03s -- next:   74 steps of 344463 remaining
...
0d10h01m39s -- next: 7802 steps of 36099 remaining
  0d07h51m37s -- next: 6854 steps of 28297 remaining
  0d05h57m23s -- next:  978 steps of 21443 remaining
  0d05h41m05s -- next: 7409 steps of 20465 remaining
  0d03h37m36s -- next: 8229 steps of 13056 remaining
  0d01h20m27s -- next: 4827 steps of 4827 remaining
  0d00h00m00s -- DONE
```

This shows a "Countdown Clock" output (obviously) measuring in
*days*, *hours*, *minutes*, and *seconds*. The start time is 4
days, 3 hours, 2 minutes, and 1 second. (For brevity part of the
output has been deleted from the middle.)

You can run the demo application again with different start values
this way:

```sh
./app_demo 0 5 30 10
```

This runs the countdown starting from 5 hours, 30 minutes, and 15
seconds:

```txt
  0d05h30m15s -- next: 6808 steps of 19815 remaining
  0d03h36m47s -- next: 5250 steps of 13007 remaining
  0d02h09m17s -- next:   74 steps of 7757 remaining
  0d02h08m03s -- next: 3659 steps of 7683 remaining
  0d01h07m04s -- next: 4024 steps of 4024 remaining
  0d00h00m00s -- DONE
```

## Following Plan A â€“ Get active with some hands-on coding

REMINDER: do not change the files in `v1` - create a new directory
(eg. `my_v1`) and copy-over all files from `v1`.

1. Understand that there are actually two `main` programs:
   * one is is part `DDD_HH_SS.c`,
   * the other is part of `unit_Test.c`
   * for a better *Separation of Responsibilities* (SRP)
     * **create a new file `run_app.cpp`** and  
     * **move the `main` program from `DDD_HH_SS.c` over to it**   
     * **also copy over the `Makefile` from `v2`**

------------------------------------------------------------------

Use `run_demo_app` to verify everything that once worked stills
gives the expected result. If anything needs to be fixed, do it
before you continue.

------------------------------------------------------------------

2. Complete the currently commented-out tests one after the other.

------------------------------------------------------------------

Use plain `make` (to run all tests) each time and if you don't get
`** unit tests passed **`

* either try to fix the problem yourself
* make a mental to discuss it later** (and leave the comment)

Y------------------------------------------------------------------

3. Understand that as a minimum `assert`-ion based tests are nice
   and emphasize the *TDD Mindset* but in practice they are clumsy
   and hence unit testing should rather be done with a framework
   specialized for that purpose.

------------------------------------------------------------------

## Following Plan B - Understand what should have been done

Do a "side by "side" comparison and try to reason why the changes
made improved the cleanliness of the code. In this reasoning
include the files newly were created to which then code of already
existing files has been moved. (Is this still KISS? Is it YAGNI?)

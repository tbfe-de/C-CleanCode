## Activities with Version 5

Now turning back from C++ to C.

**Maybe you should not completely skip though this as it a rather
advanced topic.**

If you have skipped the last two versions this is the chance to
see what C++ really does behind the scenes and how to do it at a
lower and more error prone level with type casts.

### Run the Unit Tests

Same as in the previous version – no change in observable
behavior. And even the timing should be similar.

### Run the Demo Application

Same as in the previous version – no change in observable
behavior.

## Following Plan A – Get active with some hands-on coding

If you desperately want or need to code at the low level in the
same way C++ would give you for granted, devise a plan how to
hide some of the repeating details in pro-processor macros.

## Following Plan B - Understand what should have been done

Do a side-by-side comparison with the next version to understand
how the C-preprocessor can be used to help avoiding repeated and
error prone coding.

## Activities with Version 3

This is a 1:1 reproduction version of `ChainCounter` in C++.

**Skip this if only interested in C**

### Run the Unit Tests

Same as in the previous version – only the programming language
changed, not the observable behavior.

### Run the Demo Application

Same as in the previous version – only the programming language
changed, not the observable behavior.

## Following Plan A – Get active with some hands-on coding

Again, actually programming C++ is probably not what is expected
in this course. Either continue with version 4 or follow Plan B.

## Following Plan B - Understand what should have been done

Do a side-by-side comparison and in particular note where the
C-Code needs to be more verbose than the C++-Code If you want to
be extra diligent compare the size of the executable code for the
C version to that of the C++ version.

**Hint**: When you work with Linux or most any other Unix variant
you can get a first rough estimate with the command `size`:

https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man1/size.1.html

It can be applied to both, a *whole executable file* or just an
*object module* (`*.o`-file).
